# World Cup 2022 - Group Stage Prediction

As part of the SigmaGeek challenge, I've created a model that predicts the results for the Group stage of the 2022 Qatar World Cup.

The model was based on Fifa and Elo Team Ratings and previous world cup results. 

I webscrapped the ratings and results using Python library Selenium.
